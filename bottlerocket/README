The simulation is run using the main_rocket.m script.

To set the inputs, modify the setinputs_rocket.m script.

You should not in general need to modify the calcf_rocket.m or the FE_rocket.m script.

Note: all of the scripts need to be in the same directory, or in the path where your Matlab looks for scripts.
